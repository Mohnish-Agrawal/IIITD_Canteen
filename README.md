# IIITD_Canteen

The website IIITD_Canteen is an effort by Rhythm Patel, addressing one of the most crucial problems which every hostler has to encounter at least once in a day which are: Queues.

There is often a long queue in the canteen and one has to wait a long time and due to long and unorganised order taking system. To combat this issue and make casual dining in canteen this portal has been developed.

This platform has a login system to make sure only authorised individuals can place order.
The menu would be time sensitive i.e. various items will be shown when they are available at a particular time.

This platform is implemented in DJANGO so it is fast flexible, reliable and optimised.

The web app is still under development.
